# v1.0 to do:
- sheet
  - edit cell
  - save buffer to file (with or without Row # column)
  - bug fixes
  - key bindings:
    - align key bindings with vim
    - add cmd to switch to emacs key bindings
    - save sheet prefs in zsv.ini?
  - Open file: tab for autocomplete
  - View edits (cell highlight, status bar)
  - Edit file?
  - Pivot and/or frequency table with drill-down
- CI/CD:
  - use code signing to prevent os from quarantining by default
- Documentation
  - Review / update / fix errors (README and all other)
  - Add intro + tutorial for each command (esp sheet)

# Core Parser

### Performance
- add zsv_opts option to build index while parsing
- add zsv_opts option to use index if available
- add start_row and end_row options to `zsv_opts`

### input formats
- high priority: single-registration-function support for additional file suffix support. This functionality could come from either a built-in or an extension
  - for example, `zsv_register_file_reader("bz2", ...)` and `zsvwriter_register_file_writer("bz2", ...)`
  - should also handle file formats that may contain multiple files e.g. multiple tabs in xlsx

# CLI
- add index-related parser options to general command-line options
- add `--all` option to `help` which will output all help messages for all commands (including extension commands)

## Performance
Row indexing

## Sheet
### Help menu
    - multi-tab read and write (e.g. XLSX support via plug-in)
    - column operation plug-in (add, remove, modify column)

### Data editing
- needs to support buffer-level handlers
  - for example:
    - user opens mydata.csv
    - user filters to rows that contain "xyz"; results are displayed in a new buffer
    - user tries to edit cell in the new (filtered data) buffer
      - either this attempt fails because the buffer is read-only, or
      - the buffer handles this in a specific manner to trace the edited row back to the correct row in the original data

### Buffers
- add buffer type e.g. csv etc
- add read-only flag

### Extensions
- update temp file management to centralized list with ref count
- add options to stop or cancel event handling before it is finished running. Stop = stop running, and display any progress so far in a new buffer;
  cancel = stop running, don't display anything and return as if the event handler had never started in the first place
- add extension_id to each buffer; prevent extension A from modifying (e.g. set/get ext_ctx) buffer owned by extension B
- high priority: support extension custom properties
  - save in ../zsv/extensions/xxx.ini
  - API should include functions to set/get
- Extend the my_extension.c such that when a buffer in the displayed list is selected, pressing Return will load that buffer
- cell plug-in: display context menu (e.g. for drill-down menu options)

### Interface
- progress tracking
- title line?
- help

---

## New commands

### ls
- list files that have saved zsv settings (i.e. each subdirectory in .zsv/data)

### audit/dump
- dump all file-specific saved settings (properties, edits/corrections etc)
